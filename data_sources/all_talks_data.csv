For instance, it can be used by anyone trying to add traffic control, create network policy, add observability, routing traffic to a service mesh control plane, or for load balancing. Securing your applications with a defense in depth architecture and gaining visibility in your application behavior are the two key requirements to be successful in any modern cloud native deployment. While service meshes like Istio provide these capabilities via a user space proxy mechanism it's not always feasible to inject sidecars proxies for all your applications. On the other hand Kernel technologies like eBPF when used in a CNI like Cilium provides security and metrics transparently but lacks the richness of information and policy capabilities provided by a layer 7 proxy with strong identities.In this session, We will present how we can leverage capabilities provided by both these technologies and achieve better security and observability ensuring all your applications can have uniform policy and visibility irrespective of whether they are in the mesh or not or if they are running as a container in Kubernetes or long running VM where making privileged changes are often not possible.","Shivay Lamba","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

At the heart of Apache Kafka is a set of brokers that contain topics and topics are split into partitions. Dividing topics into smaller pieces allows us to work with data in parallel and achieve higher data throughput. Such parallelization is the key to a performant cluster, however it comes with a price. First of all, reading from multiple partitions will eventually mess up the order of records, meaning  that the resulting order will be different from when the data was pushed into the cluster.Another big challenge is uneven distribution of data across partitions. Overloaded partitions present a dangerous issue for performance of all involved parties, but especially for brokers and consumers.Therefore, when building our product architecture we should carefully weigh up how many partitions we need, how to ensure proper message ordering, how to evenly balance records across partitions and not forget about data load distribution over time. And do all of this while still maintaining good performance of the cluster.If you are fresh to Apache Kafka, or you're looking for good practices to design your topic partitions and avoid common pitfalls, you'll find this session useful!","Olena Kutsenko","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

If you can put your system-under-test into a container, Docker compose cluster or a pod, this is what you're likely to use. If your target isn't ready, not containerizable or just too heavy for testing as is, you can always use mock API testing frameworks like WireMock. Can you combine both approaches? Sure! In this talk, we will classify integration testing and discuss application areas for WireMock and Testcontainers, and discuss which tool to choose for each use-case. And why not both? We will discuss putting WireMock into Testcontainers, and getting the best from their features thanks to the new modules and integrations. Last but not least, we will see how to put WireMock in front of the Testcontainers or your real system to do deeper tests or even chaos engineering. P.S: We will focus on the Java and maybe Golang examples, but the same approaches can be used in any technology stack for which the Testcontainers SDK is available.","Oleg Nenashev#Oleg Šelajev","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

In a matter of minutes you see the thread pool filling up and clients timing out. First you roll back the code, then you start to investigate the logs and ask the infrastructure guys, but nothing obvious springs to mind. Then you go over every new commit with your team, but nothing really stands out. You are unable to reproduce the problem in either regression tests or load tests. This is the kind of situation where you need the flight recorder and mission control. It allows you to capture the nitty gritty details out of your JVM at runtime with a minimal amount of overhead.Given that you run java 8 or later, both flight recorder and mission controls are now open source and free to use, even in production.Unfortunately, at the same time that we got access to the tools, our applications moved into the cloud, running in barebone containers stripped of even the most essential tools, and no longer reachable over the network. So a lot of our toolbox just went out the window!Fear not, we will connect the dots between the JDK tools and JVMs running in the cloud, using only open source tools and standards such as kubernetes and spring boot to achieve this.The presentation is based on live demonstration.","Martin Skarsaune","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

The JVM has more than 500 arguments, many of them obscure to most Java developers to tune the JVM. By analyzing garbage collection logs, JVM logs and JFR recording and the understanding of JVM internal heuristics, the recommendation engine identifies specific areas for optimization and suggest optimized JVM arguments. With this feature, developers can identify performance bottlenecks and take appropriate measures to optimize the overall performance of their applications. Java Management Cloud Service empowers enterprises to maximize the performance, security, and efficiency of their Java workloads to an even greater extent. JMS can evaluate the effort and feasibility of migrating Java applications to newer JDK versions, identify and report potential vulnerabilities (CVE) associated with 3rd party Java libraries used by applications, assess the impact of Oracle JRE and JDK Cryptographic Roadmap on application, use Java Flight Recorder to gather application runtime data, and manage the install and removal of older JDK versions to keep all your systems secured from a centralized console.","Ana-Maria Mihalceanu","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

Like the one that powers Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant? Well, we've got something awesome lined up for you!In our hands-on workshop, we'll guide you through the ins and outs of creating a question-answering system. We prefer using Python for the workshop. We have prepared a GUI that works with python. If you prefer another language, you can still do the workshop, but you will miss the GUI to test your application. You'll get your hands dirty with vector stores and Large Language Models, we help you combine these two in a way you've never done before.You've probably used search engines for keyword-based searches, right? Well, prepare to have your mind blown. We'll dive into something called semantic search, which is the next big thing after traditional searches. It’s like moving from asking Google to search ""best pizza places"" to ""Where can I find a pizza place that my gluten-intolerant, vegan friend would love?"" – you get the idea, right?We’ll be teaching you how to build an entire pipeline, starting from collecting data from various sources, converting that into vectors (yeah, it’s more math, but it’s cool, we promise), and storing it so you can use it to answer all sorts of queries. It's like building your own mini Google!We've got a repository ready to help you set up everything you need on your laptop. By the end of our workshop, you'll have your question-answering system ready and running.So, why wait? Grab your laptop, bring your coding hat, and let's start building something fantastic together. Trust us, it’s going to be a blast!Some of the highlights of the workshop:Use a vector store (OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Weaviate)Use a Large Language Model (OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere, PaLM, Bedrock)Use a tool for content extraction (Unstructured, Llama)Create your pipeline (Langchain, Custom)","Jettro Coenradie#Daniël Spee","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

In fact, I did a super-scientific poll on Twitter and found that out of 119 participants, 58% had never heard of them and 22% had heard the term but nothing more. That’s a lot of folks that need to be educated. So, let’s do that.A probabilistic data structure is, well, they’re sort of like the TARDIS—bigger on the inside—and JPEG compression—a bit lossy. And, like both, they are fast, accurate enough, and can take you to interesting places of adventure. That last one might not be something a JPEG does.More technically speaking, most probabilistic data structures use hashes to give you faster and smaller data structures in exchange for precision. If you’ve got a mountain of data to process, this is super useful. In this talk, we’ll briefly go over some common probabilistic data structures; dive deep into a couple (Bloom Filter, MinHash, and Top-K); and show a running application that makes use of Top-K to analyze the most commonly used words in all 112,092 of my UFO sightings.When we’re done, you’ll be ready to start using some of these structures in your own applications.

People have been trying to discard Java for years, but to no avail. Java, in the industry world, is very much not dead. Emerging frameworks and technologies, such as Quarkus and GraalVM, along with the constant updates to the language provided by the new 6-month release cadence make sure that Java is constantly evolving and up-to-date with industry trends.However, Java in today's universities is as dead as it can get. Even though there is a lot of innovation going on, universities never get to use those in the classroom. You can hardly find any educational institution that uses past Java 8, and students are bound to learn the “old” Java, which they despise, imprinting them the idea that Java is dead, or dying, and too old-fashioned for “modern” development.In my capacity as teaching assistant at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I am trying to change this perspective, showing students that Java is very much alive and modern.

It is a kind of so-called ""spectroheliograph"", an instrument which was invented back in 1890. With modern technologies like CMOS cameras, we can now build cheap devices which makes observing the sun accessible to everyone. What is interesting, however, is that such a device doesn't directly produce an image: software processing is mandatory, because we need to reconstruct an image from a video which only contains images of a portion of the light spectrum.With Sol'Ex, this processing has traditionally be done with INTI, a program written in Python co-authored by Christian Buil. As an amateur astronomer, I've been used to using software for astronomy image processing, but as a developer, I hadn't implemented anything myself yet. Therefore I challenged myself and started a project in order to write my own processing software, called JSol'Ex, written in Java. This project was started as an experiment, so that I understand the ""science"" behind the image reconstruction, and see if I was still capable, after 20+ years of programming, to implement algorithms based on research papers.In this session, I will explain what I have learnt: the principles of capturing images with the Sol'Ex instrument, how images are reconstructed, but also the various features I have added to JSol'Ex which make it now quite unique in its domain.","Cédric Champeau","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

Like a gentle stream, flowing over your markup and letting it burst into invigorating, saturated life. To others, CSS is the bane of their existence. An impossible game of whack-a-mole where changing one thing inevitably leads to unwanted side effects on totally unrelated places.Failing not to sound cliché, with great power comes great responsibility. Understandably, something that those with little to no affiliation with CSS are not eager to take.  At its basis, the Cascade, the C in CSS, together with specificity and inheritance, enables a very powerful system for styling the web. But it has become kind of the odd one out this last decade. We've seen the rise of conventions and frameworks that try to abstract away the complexity of authoring or work around the constraints that CSS laid upon us. But things have changed. Browser vendors are now working together for better styling cross-compatibility and CSS governance, and there are all sorts of amazing new features planned and already added to the CSS language in the last 2 years. With the advent of the Golden Era of CSS & Web UI, we have the unique opportunity to rethink how we should author CSS. I'm here to share with you where we, Web Artisans, have been, where we are and where we might be heading in terms of CSS architectures.","Maarten  Van Hoof","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

The majority of these tools (e.g. PlantUML and Mermaid) are focussed on diagramming though, and require you to create one text file per diagram, with only a limited ability to reuse diagram elements across multiple diagrams. At scale, this causes maintenance problems, and leads to inconsistencies between diagrams.This talk will introduce and demonstrate the open source Structurizr DSL - a way to create a model of your software architecture using a textual DSL that's specifically targeted towards the C4 model.

Documentation-as-code allows us to apply the same development techniques we use for our source code to our documentation. We make sure the documentation is close to our code, make it part of our builds and even write tests for our documentation.We will look at Asciidoctor as a tool which transforms documents written with Asciidoc, a Markdown-like markup, to HTML, Docbook and PDF. When we use the very simple Asciidoc markup we only focus on the content and structure of our documentation. And the really nice feature of Asciidoctor is that we can include the contents of external files, partially or completely, in the generated output. This means our documentation can reference source files that we know are correct, because we have written tests for those source files. Also because the markup is simply text we can simply see differences between versions using the tools we as developers are already familiar with.Asciidoctor has an extension API which allows us to add new functionality to Asciidoctor. This way we can also include diagrams described with text and generate graphical images from them.

It leverages OpenTelemetry behind the scenes to analyze your code runtime data as you run debug and test.  By detecting code smells, issues, and regressions as-you-code, Digma shortens the feedback loop for developers and accelerates coding in complex codebases. The plugin dynamically lints the code and provides code-lens and analytics integrated into the IDE. In addition, Digma can aggregate existing OTEL data from multiple environments, providing constant visibility and analytics into how the code is performing in the real world: Is it being used? Which functions or components don't scale? Where are the error hotspots? etc. We built Digma as a team of developers frustrated by the growing gap between observability and developers. Whereas observability has advanced considerably in recent years, developers are not yet applying it to its full potential as they write code. Our goal is to make observability transparent. Enable any developer to understand how their code behaves in runtime without having to know anything about OTEL, collector quantiles regressions, or anomaly detection.

When will you start noticing if something goes wrong? If there are so many accessible observability sources that can tell us what the code is doing, why are we using so little of that in our day-to-day coding? Continuous Feedback is a new dev practice that aims to make practical usage of code runtime data to shorten the feedback loop during development. It enables developers to get early data about their code changes and detect issues and regressions as-they-code. At the same time, collecting data from multiple environments, allows developers to instantly understand how their code is performing in the real world. In this session, we'll look past the novelty of using OSS observability tools and technologies, to discuss how we can actually make them useful for developers. We'll take a look at the benefits of enabling OpenTelemetry collection for dev and test data and examine OSS tools to help analyze the application runtime. We'll go over code examples of common anti-patterns, code smells, hidden errors, and other types of problems that observability can reveal prior to merging a PR.Ultimately, the goal should not be simply observing the application or creating nice-looking dashboards. Rather, success is in leveraging observability data in order to achieve a more effective dev process and write better code.","Roni Dover","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

OpenRewrite and JDT are two reengineering tools with a significant user base but these tools come with a high learning curve. Not only is there the formality of the Java terminology that the developer needs to (re)master but both tools have their own APIs that map to the Java Language Specification in their own specific way.

Using ADT along with pattern-matching, we can create APIs that are hard to misuse and create programs that are easier to read.All in all, in the talk we start with a problem statement and a list of requirements and then we create an implementation step-by-step by introducing requirements one by one. While we do that we make use of records, sealed types and pattern matching in Java to create elegant solution with highly readable code.","Balkrishna Rawool","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

So there’s a wealth of experience in how best to use them and in the pitfalls to avoid. And how well has the design has held up? How have collections changed with the changing priorities of the platform, and how should they change in the future? Things we'll consider:– The need for concurrent programming is driving Java towards a more functional style, but collections were designed around in-place mutation. Should immutability now be added? We’ll argue this question back and forth, with examples from other frameworks to illustrate the tradeoffs;– Anything as complex and long-lived as the collections framework is bound to attract controversies; we’ll explain some, and invite you to take sides;– We’ll take some examples of code using collections and, with your help, we’ll improve them – and maybe discover some guidelines for good practice as we go;– What about the next 25 years? We’ll look at some exciting ideas that might mean big changes in the way we program with collections.This session is for every Java developer who needs to use the collections framework – that's every Java developer. You'll leave with a deeper understanding of the design forces that shaped the framework, and with sharpened practical knowledge of how to get the very best from it.","Maurice Naftalin#Stuart Marks","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

Project Loom was created to explore, incubate and deliver Java VM features and APIs built on top of them for the purpose of supporting easy-to-use, high-throughput lightweight concurrency on the Java platform. For Java 21, Project Loom has reinstated the thread as an efficient unit of concurrency by adding a lightweight implementation of threads, called Virtual Threads, to the Java platform. Also in Java 21, Project Loom has introduced a preview API for Structured Concurrency, an approach to concurrent programming that preserves the natural relationship between tasks and subtasks, and leads to more readable, maintainable, and reliable concurrent code.This talk will present how Java has abstracted its existing thread construct to provide an alternative user-mode implementation of threads and also introduce the API for structured concurrency to treat multiple tasks running in different threads as a single unit of work.","Alan Bateman","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

These gaps have been a continual source of problems and complaints. These deficiencies have been resolved with the introduction of Sequenced Collections in JDK 21.Sequenced Collections (JEP 431) is the first new abstraction to be added to Collections since the introduction of Streams in JDK 8. Although the concept of encounter order has always been present in Collections, it has never had an explicit interface type in the API, and thus there has never been a place to define a common set of operations that apply to ordered collections. New operations include addition, retrieval, and removal of elements at either end of the collection, and the ability to view, iterate, and stream elements in reverse order.Another significant feature is the rehabilitation of LinkedHashSet and its sibling LinkedHashMap. LinkedHashSet is like an ordered Set or a List with unique elements. However, the operations on LinkedHashSet are glaringly deficient. It is a concrete class with no corresponding interface, conflicting with the idiom of programming to the interface. Sequenced Collections solves all of these problems.Attendees will learn about the new enhancements to the Collections Framework and how they can improve and streamline their code using the new Sequenced Collections APIs.","Stuart Marks","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

The SIMD architecture is not a new concept, as it was already used in parallel computers in the 80s. This session explains the differences between parallel streams and parallel computing, and how SIMD computations are working internaly on simple examples. It then shows the patterns of code that the Vector API is giving along with their performances, and how you can use them to improve your in-memory data processing computations. More advanced techniques are also presented, to go beyond the basic examples. ","José Paumard","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"

We can learn from projects with electronic components. The protocols used in the communication with displays, sensors, and LED strips are all based on the magic ones and zeros.Many years ago, I switched jobs from web development to a company building electronic devices for the rail industry. Suddenly I needed to understand the power of the smallest data unit we can use in software: bits. Yes, pure ones and zeros! We all know that #FF0000 will make the text red on a web page.

On the one hand, Valhalla is bringing Primitive Classes and Value Classes, bringing new ways for the JVM to layout your objects in memory, in order to get better performances. On the other hand, the Amber project brings back data at the center of your applications: Records bring better modelization, and along with Pattern Matching and Sealed Types, they also bring new ways to organize your business processes. In the future, Valhalla will unify object types and primitive types, with better handling of null values. Amber will continue to develop pattern matching, with deconstructors for regular classes and named patterns. These new approaches will bring new ways to better organize your applications, and to better create independent modules. The new data types Valhalla will bring you will allow you to create your object model in a different way, to get better performances for your in-memory computations. Expect to see a lot of code in this deep dive session, with new patterns, and performance considerations.","José Paumard#Remi Forax","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"
"32","With Java 21, Your Code Runs Even Faster. But How is that Possible?","https://devoxx.be/2023-schedule/talks-by-tracks/talk/?id=4454","4454","https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=4454","For most workloads, Java 21 is the fastest Java version ever released. In this short talk, we will take a peak under the hood and explore some of the performance improvements that were made in recent Java versions and how old classes even from Java 1.0 (like RandomAccessFile) were made much faster with no change in user code calling the improved classes. We will also explore some future enhancement candidates and learn how performance is usually measured by committers to the Open JDK. Buckle up for a quick ride!","Per Minborg","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"
"33","Write your own Java Profiler in 240 lines of pure Java","https://devoxx.be/2023-schedule/talks-by-tracks/talk/?id=39109","39109","https://devoxx.be/talk/?id=39109","Profilers help to analyze performance bottlenecks of your application if you know how to use them. To get to grips with profilers, it helps to understand how they work: Profilers aren't rocket science. A usable Java profiler can be written in 240 lines of pure Java code, helping you to fix performance issues and add custom features fast.This talk will give the fundamentals of Java profiling and how Java profilers typically work, followed by a detailed explanation of how to develop a functioning profiler in a few lines of Java code. This talk will also explain how you can use it in production to analyze performance issues and show briefly how to work with a widely used open-source profiler that is based on the same principles.","Johannes Bechberger","2022-08-04T10:30:00+00:00#2022-08-04T11:00:00+00:00"
